A callback function is a function we provide as an argument to another function with the intention of having it called later on.

For example:
```js
setTimeout(() => {
	console.log('2 seconds later');
}, 2000);
```

In this case, we provide a function as an argument to `setTimeOut` with the intention that `setTimeOut` is going to call the `console.log` at some point in the future.
